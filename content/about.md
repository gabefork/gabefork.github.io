# About

Hi, I'm Gabe, a current undergraduate student at UMass Amherst and a programmer who loves GPUs. I'm super interested in the intersection of hardware and software, and GPUs fascinate me the most out of all the hardware in the computer.

Aside from graphics development, I am highly active in my school's Cybersecurity Club. I am currently an Industry Director focusing on developing our relations with companies in the cybersecurity realm. I have also helped organize Capture the Flag competitions and playtested challenges in the Open Source Intelligence category.

Outside of computers, I'm interested in photography, electronic music, old video games, and transit systems.
