-  "five main obstacles to vector data management, namely the
ambiguity of semantic similarity, large size of vectors, high cost of similarity comparison, lack of structural properties that
can be used for indexing, and difficulty of efficiently answering “hybrid” queries that jointly search both attributes and vectors."

- The whole world is all about LLMs and data is typically unstructured. This calls for new databases, and vector databases are perfect for the job.

- They are also useful for "image and video search, drug discovery, facial and voice recognition, recommenda-
